## How to play ?

The goal of the game is to sort various types of garbage into the appropriate bins (Organics, Papers, Plastics, Glass, Electronics, Textiles) by swiping to change bin positions. 🗑️
Users can also drag down on a column to speed up the item. The game also includes special bonuses such as Snow, which slows down the falling items, and Multi (x2), which doubles the score temporarily. Players earn "coins", that they can use to buy custom backgrounds and more in the future. ✨
